# Flag-Hoisting-using-OpenGL
 The objective of this project is  to show graphically hoisting of a Flag. Press the key s/S to host the flag. To exit, just press esc key.

In this project we have 3 people, a flag pole and the sun.  At the beginning flag is down, which is hoisted by a person (first among the three) who walks towards the pole. 

The person approaches the flagpost and host the flag, which is shown with a good animation. Flag go up and waves out.  There is "Vande Matrama" written in right side as  flag waves. They salutes the flag.

There is s/S key which initiate the  program animation. As s/S is pressed the person in front start moving to host the flag. To exit, just press esc key.

# Set OpenGL environment in Visual Studio

First you need freeglut libraries, otherwise you cannot run OpenGL program that contain glut functions.

Microsoft SDK provides gl & glu libraries but not glut, so you must add it externally to your project.

To download the glut libraries, copy and paste this URL in search box : https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/files/software/development/GLUT/freeglut-MSVC-3.0.0-2.mp.zip
